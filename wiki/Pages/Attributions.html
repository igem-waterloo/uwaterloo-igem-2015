        <h1>Attributions</h1>
        <p>
            Our project had many moving pieces, so there are many acknowledgments to give. From our large team, to our advisors, to graduate students in nearby labs, to some previous members on our team, a number of people contributed to this project and deserve recognition.
        </p>

            A collaborative effort on all our parts. This project was chosen after weeks of pitching ideas and finding the strengths and weaknesses of them, and the entire team participated in this.

        <div style="border-top: 2px dashed black">
            <p> Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page. The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster. </p>


  <div class="highlightBox">
    <h4> Can we base our project on a previous one? </h4>
    <p>Yes! You can have a project based on a previous team, or based on someone else's idea, <b>as long as you state this fact very clearly and give credit for the original project.</b> </p>
  </div>



  <h4> Why is this page needed? </h4>
  <p>The Attribution requirement helps the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, but you must report what work your team did and what work was done by others.</p>
  <p>For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.</p>
