  <h1> Collaborations</h1>

  <p>Sharing and collaboration are core values of iGEM. We encourage you to reach out and work with other teams on difficult problems that you can more easily solve together.</p>

  <div class="highlightBox">
    <h4> Which other teams can we work with? </h4>
    <p>You can work with any other team in the competition, including software, hardware, high school and other tracks. You can also work with non-iGEM research groups, but they do not count towards the <a hreef="http://2015.igem.org/Judging/Awards#Medals">iGEM team collaboration gold medal criterion</a>.</p>

    <p>In order to meet the gold medal criteria on helping another team, you must complete this page and detail the nature of your collaboration with another iGEM team.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Here are some suggestions for projects you could work on with other teams:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> Improve the function of another team's BioBrick Part or Device</li>
    <li> Characterize another team's part </li>
    <li> Debug a construct </li>
    <li> Model or simulating another team's system </li>
    <li> Test another team's software</li>
    <li> Help build and test another team's hardware project</li>
    <li> Mentor a high-school team</li>
  </ul>
